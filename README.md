# Prediction-of-Car-Purchase-Amount-Using-ANNs
In this project, I will be using artificial neural network to develop a model that will be used to predict the total amount in dollar that customers are willing to pay based on the following attributes from a synthetic dataset:
- Customer Name
- Customer e-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary 
- Credit Card Debt 
- Net Worth 

Output to predict: 
- Car Purchase Amount

**The following steps are followed for the data analysis and Prediction:**
- Step 1: Import Libraries and datasets
- Step 2: EDA - Explore/Visualize Dataset
- Step 3: Create Testing and training dataset/Data Cleaning
- Step 4: Model Training
- Step 5: Model Evaluation
